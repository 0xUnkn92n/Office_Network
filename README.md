Hi folks
* This is basic model of Network
* By using cisco packet tracer we can design networking
* All connections are pretty easy you can follow as per file
* So for configuring Routers we have to follow some steps(in this project i used dynamic routing)
 1. #Configuring Router(Dynamic) :-
 2. #Router>(this is the interface when you open cli)
 3. #Router>en or enable
 4. #Router#(changed to previliged mode)
 5. #Router#configure terminal or conf t
 6. #Router(config)#Router eigrp 100 (in this we use advance distance network protocal i.e EIGRP(enhance interior gateway protocol) (any number between 0-65535)
 7. #Router(config-if)#network IP Address(known network)
 8.             ''       ''        ''     ''
 9.             ''       ''        ''     ''
 10. #Router(config-if)#exit
 
* That's it you are good to go ;)
