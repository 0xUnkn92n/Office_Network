Hi folks
This is basic model of Network
By using cisco packet tracer we can design networking
All connections are pretty easy you can follow as per file
So for configuring Routers we have to follow some steps(in this project i used dynamic routing)
 #Configuring Router(Dynamic) :-
 #Router>(this is the interface when you open cli)
 #Router>en or enable
 #Router#(changed to previliged mode)
 #Router#configure terminal or conf t
 #Router(config)#Router eigrp 100 (in this we use advance distance network protocal i.e EIGRP(enhance interior gateway protocol) (any number between 0-65535)
 #Router(config-if)#network IP Address(known network)
              ''       ''        ''     ''
              ''       ''        ''     ''
 #Router(config-if)#exit
 
That's it you are good to go ;)
